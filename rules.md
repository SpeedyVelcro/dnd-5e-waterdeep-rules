# Character Creation Rules
You may roll your ability scores or use point-buy. If you roll your ability
scores, I must be able to observe and verify your rolls as you make them.

Character sheets need to be verified with me before bringing them to the table. I'll check that you didn't forget anything or make any mistakes, and we'll also go over your backstory ideas and fit them into the setting.

I find creating characters with people pretty fun so feel free to reach out if you need help.

You may optionally use the following character creation rules:
- Variant: Customizing Ability Scores (PHB pg. 13)
- Variant Human Traits (PHB pg. 31)
- Feats (PHB pg. 165)
- Multiclassing (PHB pg. 163)
- Customizing Your Origin (TCoE pg. 7) including all the subheadings underneath and the "Custom Lineage" sidebar

## Legal Book List
When creating characters or levelling up you are allowed to use races, classes, subclasses, feats, backgrounds and spells from the following sourcebooks only:
- Player's Handbook
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything
- Monsters of the Multiverse
- Fizban's Treasury of Dragons
- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

If a race, class, subclass, feat or spell appears in multiple books, you may only use the most recently published version.

## Legal Character Sheet Formats
Characters should initially be made on the official 5e character sheet, as this is easier to check. Afterwards, you may port your character to any of the following formats:
- Official 5e character sheet (pdf or pencil & paper)
    - It's recommended you use [this sheet](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/213388/5e-Inventory-and-Equipment-Revisited) for managing your inventory
    - Please put book and page number references next to abilities so we can check rules quickly during play
- Foundry VTT character sheet


# Variant Rules
We are using several variant rules. **Particularly note the following, which will have a major impact on how the game plays**:
- More Difficult Identification (DMG pg. 136)
- Flanking (DMG pg. 251)

We are also using the following player-facing variant rules:
- Identifying a Spell (DMG pg. 271)
- Perceiving a Caster at Work (XGtE pg. 85)
- Invalid Spell Targets (XGtE pg. 85)

There are also several rules that I may use to provide you with extra options, however these are situational:
- Extra Downtime Activities (XGtE pg. 125), situational availability
- Tying Knots (XGtE pg. 78) but using a **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)** check instead, for consistency as we are not using "Variant: Skills with Different Abilities"
- Tool Proficiencies (XGtE pg. 78)
- Disarm Action (DMG pg. 271)

# House Rules
- If, when levelling up, you choose average hit die instead of rolling, you **round down** instead of rounding up.
- We are using experience levelling.
    - You won't get experience if you are absent. This is because the XP curve already acts as a natural catch-up mechanism for lower-level players.
    - I may intervene with free XP or multipliers in the event that players are absent enough that they drift more than a couple levels apart, so you shouldn't have to worry about falling behind.
- Characters will only level up on a long rest. Characters can level up multiple times on the same long rest if they have the experience.
- Small items that aren't given a set weight - like potions - are treated as weighing **0.1 lb**. Money will weigh **1 lb per 50 coins** (Foundry VTT already calculates money weight for you). Lenience is given for handwaving the weight of small amounts of light items if you are using a paper character sheet.
- A creature may end their movement in the same tile as an unconcious creature.
    - Performing a melee attack against an unconcious creature sharing a space with a concious creature provokes an opportunity attack from the concious creature.
    - Administering first aid to an unconcious creature sharing a space with a concious creature provokes an opportunity attack from the concious creature.
    - Interacting with an unconcious creatures haring a space with a concious creature in any way that requires touching the unconcious creature provokes an opportunity attack from the concious creature.

# Rulings

# Rule Clarifications
These are RAW, not variant or house rules, but they bear mentioning here just to make sure everyone's on the same page
- Ability Checks: Nat 20 is not an auto-auccess, nat 1 is not an auto-fail
- We're using default encumbrance rules. Please keep track of your encumbrance - this is actually important for this adventure since your may encounter stuff that's too much to carry normally! If you're on paper/PDF and you want an easy way to track encumbrance, I would recommend this sheet: https://www.dmsguild.com/product/213388/5e-Inventory-and-Equipment-Revisited
